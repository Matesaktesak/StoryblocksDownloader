# Storyblocks Downloader
This repo contains scripts for downloading the song PREVIEWS when not logged in to [Storyblocks.com](https://storyblocks.com/audio/search) and for batch downloading search results when logged in.
The need for the batch_downloader.js scripts comes, because Storyblocks doesn't normally allow you to batch download WAV format files.

**This script will not help you pirate the licensed music/SFX** it can only download what it already available to you as a user.

These scripts might break with future revisions of the Storyblocks site, and come with NO WORRANTY nor support.

### Usage

To use the scripts, first install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). Than create a new script in there and paste the file from here. One you visit a storyblocks.com/audio site, the scripts activate automaticly.

**When BATCH downloading, set the desired file destination as default in your browser and unselect 'Ask on every download'** otherwise you'll go mad clicking 'OK'...

# WARNING

Storyblocks prohibits usage of scripts such as this one in the 'Individual License'. You are not allowed to "stock-pile clips", with an example given, that downloding a few dozen is no problem, but downloading 500 definitly breaks the rules and the spirit of them.

My subscription was canceled after about 2000 downloaded files.
